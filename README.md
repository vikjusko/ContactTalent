## Program that accepts two inputs:
![Alt text](https://i.ibb.co/ctk2w7z/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-13-50-23.png)

- A JSON array of talent, containing objects with `name`, `location` and `date_of_birth` attributes
- A location to filter by

The program should then filter the array of supplied talent, and output the names of talent whose location matches the location supplied. The supplied location should be consider case-insensitive, and the order in which names are outputted is not important.
